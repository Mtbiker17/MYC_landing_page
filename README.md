This is a super simple landing page to show as an example for the Midcoast Youth Center "15 to 30" Fundraiser. My attempt is simply to get a some html practice while providng an actual web product for a business, while taking a short break from learning JavaScript.

I'll apply basic html, basic CSS and will not include JavaScript as it isn't necessary and also I am not well-versed enough.

11/6/20: This was a helpful project in learning some new aspects of HTML including understanding <div> slightly more and how to use them as parent and child div's, the use of <span> as well as committing to GitHub. My weaknesses I notice are organization of code, naming of classes & id's as well as designing <div> in order to layout certain html blocks or sections in the appropriate places. I'll revisit this after some more work with the Odin Project.
