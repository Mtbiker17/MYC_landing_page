This is a  super simple landing page to show as an example for the Midcoast Youth Center 15 to 30 Fundraiser. My attempt is simply to get a quick html practice in to take a one day break from learning JavaScript.

I'll apply basic html, basic CSS and will not include JavaScript as it isn't necessary and also I am not well-versed enough.
